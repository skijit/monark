Monark Presets Repo
===================

- This will store:
    - monark patches
        - stored internally as 'snapshots' in the ensemble file
    - demo tracks (for patches)

- Not stored
    - ableton instrument racks which are stored in the Ableton Live User Library
        - I have a separate git repo for this...

- Procedure
    - See instructions on how to manage presets/patches [here](http://notes.skjei.org/music/misc-production/monark#Ableton-Integration)
